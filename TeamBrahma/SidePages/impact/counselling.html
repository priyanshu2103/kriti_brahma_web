In other words strict confidentiality is maintained in the counseling service. No information is passed on to anyone without the client’s consent. However, an exception to confidentiality occurs when a situation suggests that the client may pose a danger to him or herself or others.

                        <p>"Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. 
In the current climate of ever increasing stress, cut throat competition, and increasing consumerism, it is only natural for any of us to encounter social, personal, or academic problems. The constant pressure and expectation from oneself and significant others often leads to emotional or psychological turmoil, thus disturbing the peace of mind.
When one is away from his/her comfort zone, a mentor, a counsellor, a saathi emerges as ‘a shelter in the storm’. Saathi, the counselling service of IIT Guwahati, has experienced counsellors and a dedicated team who are ready to take the responsibility of guiding and supporting the students in their path towards success and self-fulfillment. This includes handling personal, family and peer problems as well as managing academics more responsibly.
The counsellors provide a comfortable and confidential environment where the students feel at ease to discuss anything that may be bothering them, and help find solution to their problems.</p>

                        <h3>Why counselling is needed?</h3>
                        <p>Institutions such as IIT serve as a great place for higher learning and maximum life exposure to all, but at the same time it brings along some inevitable pressures from unexpected areas. Many thrive on the challenges of this stimulating environment, but at times people become tired, overwhelmed, irritable, anxious or depressed. In such matters, typically people struggle with their issues internally, mulling them over in their mind trying to sort out possible solutions to their dilemmas. They may speak with family members and friends, but they may feel it is not enough. At this stage, it is reasonable as well as crucial to speak with a counselor.

</p>

                        <h3>What is counselling</h3>
                        <p>
                            Counselling denotes a principled and professional relationship in which a wide variety of procedures (such as psychotherapy, psychometric testing, relaxation therapy and hypnosis etc.) are applied for helping individuals achieve better adjustment. Counselling gives the client an opportunity to explore their stressful and emotional feelings and gradually discover more satisfying and resourceful ways of living. The goal of counseling is not to change the fundamental characteristics that make a person special. Rather, its goal is to put the person/client in charge of making changes which is necessary for realizing their full potential, but not at the cost of their beliefs and values.
