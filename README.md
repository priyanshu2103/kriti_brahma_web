# kriti_brahma_web

Inside Team Brahma, there is one dir missing by the name vendors.(actually it is there but it is corrupted)
I have uploaded a separate repo named vendors.
Both are private.

Go zip the kriti_web_master first, delete the vendors repo in Team Brahma... and then zip the vendors repo and copy in Team brahma, now go to the main_page.html in production directory

Go in the production section and open main_page.html
This is the main page.
Rest all html pages in production and SidePages(directory) are linked to this main page.
